# Power-BI - Sales Data Analysis

## Power BI is a business analytics tool from Microsoft designed to help users visualize and share insights from their data. It allows for creating interactive reports and dashboards by connecting to a wide range of data sources, transforming raw data, and providing various options for analysis. Here are some key features and components:

**Power BI Desktop:** A Windows application where users build and edit reports and data models. It provides tools for data transformation, visualization, and advanced analytics, including DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) functions for complex calculations and custom measures.

**Power BI Service:** The online counterpart to Power BI Desktop, where users can share, collaborate on, and publish reports and dashboards. It enables automatic data refresh, real-time data monitoring, and collaboration through workspaces and sharing capabilities.

**Power BI Mobile:** Mobile apps for viewing and interacting with Power BI dashboards on iOS, Android, and Windows devices.

**Data Sources and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):** Power BI can connect to various data sources (SQL databases, Excel, cloud services, etc.), and Power Query enables users to clean, shape, and transform data.

**DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** A formula language for creating custom calculations and measures, similar to Excel but more powerful for relational and time-series data.

**Reports and Dashboards:** Reports are multi-page, interactive visuals built in Power BI Desktop, while dashboards are single-page snapshots created in the Power BI Service, often featuring pinned visuals from reports.

**AI and Machine Learning:** Power BI integrates with Microsoft AI to provide insights, including anomaly detection, forecasting, and other ML features.
